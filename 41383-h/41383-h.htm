<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Invention of Puppet Shows, Tumbling and other public
amusements, carries us back to a period in history long anterior
to the birth of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, Games of Chance, as well as the sports and pastimes
usually enjoyed in their Plays, by the early people of Egypt,
were in their zenith in the reign of the <span class="smcap">Rameses</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Rameses</span> the II. was a magnificent patron of letters as well
as art.</p>

<p class="indent">The "Sacred Library," which Diodorus mentions, has been
discovered in his Palace, the Rameseum at Karnak.</p>

<p class="indent">Nine men of learning were attached to the person of this
King, and at their head was a certain <span class="smcap">Kagabu</span>, as "Master of
the Rolls," (Books) a man "unrivaled in elegance of style and
diction."</p>

<p class="indent">From the pen of this master, who may have helped to train
the mind of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, the King&#39;s adopted grandson, in "all the
learning of the Egyptians," we still possess the oldest Fairy Tale
in the world, a moral story, resembling that of Joseph and his
Brethren, composed for the King&#39;s son Meneptha, who afterwards
became the opponent of Moses, at the time of the exodus
of the Jews from Egypt.</p>

<p class="indent">Our object is not so much with the antiquity of shows, as it
is directly with the introduction of "<span class="smcap">Punch and Judy</span>" into
polite society; in proper character, free from superfluous verbiage,
and dressing the play in phraseology commensurate with
the progress of the age&mdash;good taste and refinement.</p>

<p class="indent">The performance of <span class="smcap">Punch</span> in the streets of European cities,
unpurified of the vulgar colloquies put into his mouth, by the
man who works the Puppets, would not for an instant be tolerated
by the people of this country.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
"The Play of <span class="smcap">Punch and Judy</span>," observes a writer in <i>Harper&#39;s
Monthly</i>, "was exhibited for a short time at a popular
place of amusement in New York City, in 1870, but did not
take sufficiently with the audience to induce the managers to
go on with it."</p>

<p class="indent">The true cause of its failure, at the time, doubtless arose from
the vulgar and impure language, used by the fellow that worked
the Figures.</p>

<p class="indent">Where the little Puppets have been properly conducted, the
popularity of the show has been unbounded.</p>

<p class="indent">With the assistance of Mr. Cruikshank&#39;s admirable illustrations,
it may be made the medium of the most amusing whimsicalities.
We are told that so grave and dignified a personage
as an English Secretary of State is certain to be, once paused
on his way from Downing street to the <span class="smcap">House of Commons</span> on
a night of important debate to witness the whole performance.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS.</h2>

<h3>How to Perform the Puppets.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Frame should be three feet long and two feet wide:
there should be a space of 16 inches high, between the stage,
on which the Puppets perform, and the top of the Frame, corresponding
to the ceiling of a room, from which a little curtain
hangs and in all particulars resembling a miniature theatre,
with small wings on the sides, like the scenes in a large theatre,
and a curtain in front to drop, or slide across the stage, at the
end of each act, is necessary. Immediately above the stage is
a small stick running across the top, from which a small fringe
hangs, in the style of a curtain, between this fringe and the top
of the stage, is a space of 16 inches, for the Puppets to perform.</p>

<p class="indent">The hight of the stage, or floor on which the Puppets move,
from the ground upward, must be regulated by the hight of the
person performing the Figures: the stage, therefore, should
never exceed two inches higher than the head of the person
who stands behind it, inside of the Frame. This will enable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
the performer to rest his hands on the back part of the stage
without being seen by the audience. Without this relief for
the hands to rest on, he could not be able to continue the
movement of the Figures to any length of time.</p>

<p class="indent">On one end of the Frame (the stage part) is a small socket,
in which the end of a movable gallows is fixed.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole of the Frame is covered outside with thick cloth,
to conceal all that may be done on the inside.</p>

<p class="indent">Three bags hang in front of the performer&mdash;extending across
the Frame; and on the right and left hand sides, are four more
pockets&mdash;two on each side&mdash;making seven altogether; about
six or eight inches deep.</p>

<p class="indent">In these pockets are placed the little Wooden Actors. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>
and the <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>, occupy the same bunk. <span class="smcap">Judy</span>, with her child,
and the dog <span class="smcap">Toby</span> have a bunk to themselves. The <span class="smcap">Constable</span>
and <span class="smcap">Jack Ketch</span>, room together. The <span class="smcap">Negro</span> and the <span class="smcap">Devil</span>
have separate berths.</p>

<p class="indent">The way to hold the Puppets in order to exhibit them to the
public:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Punch</span> is always held by the showman&#39;s right hand, his
head is wood of course, and should be five inches, allowing
two inches for the length of neck would make it seven inches
long, five inches from the neck to the top of the head, with a
hole, for the finger to rest in, three inches deep. Into this little
hole in the head fits the showman&#39;s fore finger while his second
finger fits into <span class="smcap">Punch&#39;s</span> right hand, and the exhibitor&#39;s thumb
sets in <span class="smcap">Punch&#39;s</span> left hand. Thus, by the aid of the exhibitor&#39;s
fore finger and thumb, <span class="smcap">Punch</span> is enabled to wield the club he
carries with such consummate dexterity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Judy</span> is held by the left hand and managed in the same way:
thus, when the exhibitor has <span class="smcap">Punch</span> and <span class="smcap">Judy</span> ready to commence
the show they are said to be well mounted.</p>

<p class="indent">How to make the dresses and to dress the Figures.&mdash;The
dress of each Puppet is a gown fastened around its neck about
thirteen inches long, on to this is sewed the coat, shirt, vest
and pantaloons. Inside of the gown the showman thrusts his
hand for the working of the little Actor&mdash;described above.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
The <span class="smcap">Punch</span> Puppet, has a big belly and a haunch on his back
between his shoulders, which gives him the appearance of the
Lord Mayor of London.</p>

<p class="indent">The Play opens by the appearance of Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> who calls
<span class="smcap">Judy</span> to his aid. Here commences the dance by <span class="smcap">Punch</span> and
<span class="smcap">Judy</span>, who bow to the audience, then to each other and at the
sound of music move off in the dance.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not necessary that the feet of the Puppets should be
seen, consequently they are seldom brought into view.</p>

<p class="indent">The person inside the Frame when dancing the Puppets,
must go through all the capers he wishes the Figures to perform;
and as he is entirely concealed from view, he can be just
as funny as he pleases; and in proportion to his comic actions
will the little Actors appear to the audience.</p>

<p class="indent">And strange as it may seem should the exhibitor fail to carry
out these instructions, namely: of moving his body, so as to
correspond with the motions he wishes to give the Figures, the
dance of <span class="smcap">Punch</span> and his wife would be flat&mdash;without fun or any
interest whatever. Therefore, remember and fail not to put in
all the comic points, (motions) for in this lies the secret of giving
life and merriment to the <span class="smcap">Punch</span> and <span class="smcap">Judy</span> Show.</p>

<h2>Act 1. Scene 1st.</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Punch</span>&mdash;<i>is heard below with a loud squeak: he makes his
appearance from the wing on the right hand side of the stage
dancing and singing. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Punch</span>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span>&mdash;Good day little people&mdash;how do you do? The funniest
man I ever saw was old <span class="smcap">Joe Miller</span>. But the smartest
chap among them all was <span class="smcap">Jack</span> the <span class="smcap">Giant Killer</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">The biggest thing on the ice is an Elephant&mdash;he is not a pretty
bird&mdash;and never travels without a trunk. The Pig is a
smaller bird&mdash;somebody shot his feathers all off.</p>

<p class="indent">(<span class="smcap">Judy</span> <i>answers from below.</i>) I am coming darling. (<i>Enter</i>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span>&mdash;I should think I did&mdash;had you been here sooner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
you would have seen the man that lived in the "House that
Jack built."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Judy.</span>&mdash;Did you see him?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span>&mdash;I only saw one side of him&mdash;that is why I wanted
you here&mdash;you could have stood on one side, and I on the
other, and then we could have seen the whole of him at one
time. <i>He was orful!</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Judy.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, you are such a funny man: now let us
have a nice little dance.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span>&mdash;With all my heart. (<i>They join hands&mdash;bow to the
audience&mdash;then to themselves and step off, keeping time with
the sound of the music.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Judy.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, I am going down stairs to bring up the
<span class="smcap">Baby.</span> (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Judy</span>.)</p>

<p class="indent">(<span class="smcap">Punch</span>&mdash;<i>continues to dance&mdash;a negro comes up slyly behind
him and hits him a heavy blow on the side of his head, and
before</i> <span class="smcap">Punch</span> <i>gets a glance at him, darts out of sight.</i> <span class="smcap">Punch</span>
<i>scratches his head, looks about the stage&mdash;seemingly much
perplexed&mdash;but is soon relieved by the appearance of</i> <span class="smcap">Judy</span>
<i>with the</i> <span class="smcap">Child</span>. <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Judy</span> <i>with the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Judy.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, here is our own little darling: you hold
the child while I go down in the kitchen and prepare dinner&mdash;mind
you&mdash;don&#39;t you slap or pinch it, to make it cry. (<i>He
takes the Child. Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Judy</span>.)</p>

<p class="indent">(<span class="smcap">Punch</span> <i>sings</i>) "It is good to be a father," etc. (<i>He tries to

(<i>Throws the Child up and catches it.</i>) Catchee, catchee, catchee!
